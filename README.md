# Digimon Card Game (Database)

## Description
From webscrapping to inserting the data in SQLite, using python. There's only one code per card, parallel rare were excluded because they have the same features and code to their original card (no parallel rare). 

The code is designed to webscrape even the newest decks, it doesn't matter the date of the update, if the deck is in the page, it will get it.  

The data were taken from the official website of [Digimon Card Game](https://en.digimoncard.com/cardlist/?search=true&category=508101)
